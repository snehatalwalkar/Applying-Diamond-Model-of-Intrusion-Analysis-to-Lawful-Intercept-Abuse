# Applying-Diamond-Model-of-Intrusion-Analysis-to-Lawful-Intercept-Abuse

Abstract—UAE government, a nation-state adversary targeted
their own human rights defender, Ahmed Mansoor, with the
‘Trident’, a chain of zero-day exploits designed to infect his
iPhone with sophisticated commercial spyware on Aug 10th,
2016. This incident of Lawful Intercept (LI) abuse is analyzed
using the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis in the following
report. Detailed investigation and evidence gathering was possible
because Ahmed Mansoor chose to report suspicious messages
on his iPhone to Citizen Lab (an interdisciplinary laboratory
based at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy,
University of Toronto) and Citizen Lab along with the Lookout
Security researchers initiated a responsible disclosure process
and contacted Apple on Aug 15th, 2016.1 Only after Apple
released the patch for the exploits, these researchers published a
report, titled, ‘THE MILLION DOLLAR DISSIDENT’ on Aug
24th, 2016[1]. Majority of this incident analysis relies on this
report and continues to further investigate, how the incident
links with US mercenaries based on a Reuter’s article titled,
‘Special Report: Inside the UAE’s secret hacking team of U.S.
mercenaries’ drawing the need for transnational laws governing
LI[2]
